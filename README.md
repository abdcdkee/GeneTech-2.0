# GeneTech-2.0
The project involved replication of, and improving upon the GeneTech software. It was started as a part of my Data Structures and Algorithms course in Jan 2018 and culminated with the publishing of a paper titled "GeneTech 2.0: Improved Genetic Circuit Synthesis and Technology Mapping" at the Tenth International Workshop for Bio-Design Automation, UC Berkeley, California in Aug 2018.

The project was conducted alongside Adil Ali Khan under the supervision of Dr. Hasan Baig (Habib University) and Dr. Jan Madsen (Technical University of Denmark)
